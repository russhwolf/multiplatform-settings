/**
 * A collection of storage-backed key-value data
 *
 * This class allows storage of values with the [Int], [Long], [String], [Float], [Double], or [Boolean] types, using a
 * [String] reference as a key. Values will be persisted across app launches.
 *
 * The specific persistence mechanism is defined using a platform-specific implementation, so certain behavior may vary
 * across platforms. In general, updates will be reflected immediately in-memory, but will be persisted to disk
 * asynchronously.
 *
 * Operator extensions are defined in order to simplify usage. In addition, property delegates are provided for cleaner
 * syntax and better type-safety when interacting with values stored in a `Settings` instance.
 *
 * On the JS platform, this class can be created by passing a [Storage] instance which will be used as a delegate. By
 * default [localStorage] will be used if nothing is provided.
 *
 * Unlike the implementations on Android and iOS, `JsSettings` does not include a [Settings.Factory] because
 * the `Storage` API does not provide a way to create multiple named instances.
 *
 * This class is experimental as marked by the [ExperimentalJs] annotation.
 *
 * The experimental listener APIs are not implemented in `JsSettings`.
